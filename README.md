# Tiny C++ Script of Downloading Bing Wallpaper

This project is inspired by [hejianjiao/BingWallpaper](https://github.com/hejianjiao/BingWallpaper).


## Requirements

* a C++17 compatible compiler such as GCC or Clang.
* CMake (recommended).
* [Kerbal](https://github.com/WentsingNee/Kerbal), a C++ template library written by me. (If you like it, please give me a star  ^_^ )
* [CPR](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr), a simple C++ wrapper around libcurl.
* [nlohmann json](https://github.com/azadkuh/nlohmann_json_release), a C++ JSON parser.


# Note

If your GCC version is under 9.1.0 (7.x, 8.x, etc.), you need to link libstdc++fs.a .
